# DoNotDisturb

A Swift application to notify my loved ones that I am working at the moment and can not be disturbed.

I can press the button on an iPad and my family will get a notification to the iPhone.

Here I also used the Firebase to set up a database and SwiftUI for the layout of the iPhone side.
