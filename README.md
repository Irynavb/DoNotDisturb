# DoNotDisturb (Shush Pls)

I am building this Swift application to be able to easier and faster notify my loved ones that I am working at the moment and can not be disturbed.

I can press the button on an iPad and my family will get a notification to the iPhone.

It is still in progress, the first raw version though is below:

Here I used the `Firebase` to set up a database and `SwiftUI` for the layout of the iPhone side, as well as the `AVFoundation` with its `AVAudioPlayer` to play the notifications.
